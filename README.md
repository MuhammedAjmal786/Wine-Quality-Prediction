# Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains implementations and analyses related to Wine Quality prediction, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Wine dataset.
- Flask Web Application for Wine Quality Prediction.

## Aim: 
Give inputs (alcohol, malic acid, ash, alkalinity of ash, magnesium, total phenols, flavanoids, nonflavanoid phenols, proanthocyanins, color_intensity, hue, od315_of_diluted_wines, proline) Contents. 
And predict Wine Quality based on these inputs
## Features
- Perform EDA to understand the dataset and key patterns.
- Use machine learning models to predict diabetes.
- Save model using Pickle.
- Deploy interactive web applications using Flask.

   git clone https://github.com/MuhammedAjmal786/Wine-Quality-Prediction.git
   cd Wine-Quality-Prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pickle
   pip install flask
   ```

3. Run the applications:
   - **EDA**: Run Jupyter notebooks inside the `wine` folder.
     
   - **Flask App**:
     ```bash
     cd flsk
     python flsk.py
     ```
